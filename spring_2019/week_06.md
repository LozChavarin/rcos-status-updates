## Last Week's Accomplishments

> The model is finally completed apart from the iron base plate and the bowl feeder. But the original file for the bowl has already been printed it's not immediately necessary to re-do that part. 

## This Week's Plan

> This week I need to get all the finished parts printed and make any necessary adjustments so that they assemble correctly. 

## Anything Blocking?

> It might be difficult sourcing the iron for the base plate which lies adjacent to the electromagnetic coil. That part cannot be 3D printed.
