## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this past week I haven't made as much progress as I would have liked on the cad model. I finished modeling the bowl feeder base plate and partially modeled one of the four springs.

## This Week's Plan

> The goal this week is complete at least two other model parts. Excluding the bowl feeder the final pieces will be simpler than the base plate. 

## Anything Blocking?

> Not really any blockers.
