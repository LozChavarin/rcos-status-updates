## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this past week I haven't made as much progress as I would have liked on the model. Some steel materials were gathered from the processes shop to use to make the electromagnet.
> 
> I wound some copper wire several dozen times around the cylinder and tested it using a 9V battery. Unfortunately the copper I used wasn't insulated so current didn't flow in the correct orientation to create a magnetic field.

## This Week's Plan

> Alter the electromagnetic clamps to fit the 16mm diameter steel cylinder we picked up and buy enameled copper to replace the non-insulated coils.

>Re-wire the electromagnetic and verify that it's functioning correctly.

## Anything Blocking?

> The only suitable pieces found at the processes shop aren't compatible with the dimensions of the parts already printed. And I still haven't been able to source a thinner metal sheet for the bottom of the bowl feeder.
