## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I reevaluated my efforts last semester to create a prototype. One issue with the previous conveyor belt was the fragility of the components used and the high tolerance for error during construction. I acquired new motors and other components like a rubber belt. I measured the new components and sketched out a new schematic to use for the next conveyor belt.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> This week I want to grab some wood and build a new base for the conveyor belt from the schematic I made last week. The goal next week is to construct the base for the conveyor belt and test out the new motors.    

## Anything Blocking?

> Getting access to the right machinery for cutting the wooden base might be an issue shouldn't be a problem.
