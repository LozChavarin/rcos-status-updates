## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Given the upfront cost of materials for constructing the conveyor belt out of wood I opted instead to model the pieces I need in NX. So those parts were finished and now just need to get printed. 

## This Week's Plan

> The plan this week is to get those pieces 3D printed at the Forge and change the 3D model accordingly to fix any mistakes made in the first model. 
> The second large goal for next week is completing the vibratory bowl 3D model. Excluding the top funnel on the bowl. 

## Anything Blocking?

>I have no knowledge of a way to create a spiral in the X direction while also widening in the XY plane. I am going to ask at the Forge when I begin working on the piece and hopefully get that cleared up.
