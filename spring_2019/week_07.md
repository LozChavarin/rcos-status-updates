## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week all the modeled pieces were printed at the forge. Initially there were serious printing issues with line adhesion and print sticking to the printer's heating plate.
> 
> This resulted in the first batch finishing with some broken and malformed pieces. After some adjustments later the second printing came out fine. 

## This Week's Plan

> Finish some of the pieces by sanding them and put together the bottom half of the sorter. Which includes connecting the stand to the base plate and securing the clamps for the electromagnet.  

## Anything Blocking?

> Sourcing an iron or nickel plate approximately 1.5mm thick to cut at the forge laser cutter will be the bottleneck for our progress.
