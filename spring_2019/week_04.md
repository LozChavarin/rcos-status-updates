## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Finished modeling the stand for the vibratory bowl and partially completed the connecting attachment for the stand and the electromagnetic coil. 
> 
> Failed to 3D print the conveyor belt side sections. 

## This Week's Plan

> Finish modeling the connecting section and base for the coil. 

## Anything Blocking?

> Minor requirements for each model such as ensuring each sketch is fully constrained takes an inordinate amount of time due to my inexperience with the software.
> 
> Trying to find an open printer outside of class time.

## Notes

> These pieces are being done as an assembly which makes it more convenient to manipulate the several components that are a part of this model. But that also leaves more room for error when each individual component is combined.
