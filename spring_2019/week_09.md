## Last Week's Accomplishments

> After some research I discovered that hollow metal won't be as effective for creating a magnetic field. A large section of the steel cylinder is hollowed out so instead I used a one and a half inch carbon steel Hex screw as the core for the electromagnet. But there is a trade off since the screw has less total metal compared to the cylinder. Which may in turn result in a smaller magnetic field than might otherwise be possible. 
> 
> I coiled the enameled copper wire down the length of the screw and tested it with a 9V battery. This worked much better but the field was still extremely weak. Smaller steel pieces were shifted towards the magnet only when they were within a couple millimeters of the screw. 

>The clamps were also filed to more easily accommodate the electromagnet.

## This Week's Plan

> For this week I need to re-wire the electromagnet again, this time being careful to fit as many turns as possible on the screw. 

> Testing the electromagnet has depleted the one 9V battery I have so I need to buy some more and possibly try hooking it up to a AC power supply to circumvent the need for a battery.
