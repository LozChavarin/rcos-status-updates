## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week I re-wound the electromagnet (EC) yet again. This time there are over 200 turns of copper wire. To create the strongest possible field the EC may need to be re-done but for now its field strength is good enough for our purposes. 
> 
>Using all the parts we previously printed we assembled a prototype. 

## This Week's Plan

>This week we are doing presentations so some time will be devoted to practicing and working on the slides.

> Continue to make improvements to the prototype.

## Anything Blocking?
> I need to make a clock source to connect the EC but the only wave source generator I have can't push that much current.
