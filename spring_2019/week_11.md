## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week I made a new electromagnet with tape between each layer of coils so that more loops could be made on a same size screw. 

## This Week's Plan

> For this week I want to have connect the new electromagnet to a more finely finished prototype.

## Anything Blocking?

> Not really any blockers.
